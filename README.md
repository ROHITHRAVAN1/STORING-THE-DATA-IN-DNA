# STORING-THE-DATA-IN-DNA
One of the major problems faced today in data storage is the data loss
due to crashing of storage devices like magnetic disc or optical disc.
Everyday lot of data is produced and this requires high density storage
devices which can retain values for a long time. In recent years
scientists have turned their attention towards the biomaterials for data
storage. The growing demand of digital information storage worldwide
has led to the development of technology of using DNA as novel
storage media. A new type of storing digital information within the DNA
of living organism is attracting more attentions. DNA is a suitable
storage method due to its high data density, environment compatibility
and long-term storage potential. However, despite the low cost and
high-throughput advantages, this type of DNA storage also has
shortcomings such as limited DNA quantity, difficulty replicating, etc.
Pilot studies of DNA storage in representative living organisms such as
E. coli, yeast and Arabidopsis, are conducted. This is achieved by the
process called induced mutation which is controlled by electrical
signals.
Data stored in DNA is more reliable than any other devices. This
invention provides a hope for future data storage which will be safe for
millions of years, as they are transmitted over various generations. We
can cultivate the bacteria in which the data are stored in various places
like fish tank, garden, stomach and plants and seeds also. Moreover, a
naked DNA molecule can be greatly affected by environmental
influences, thus resulting in DNA mutations and changes in the stored
information. Research demonstrates the great potential of plants and
seeds in circumventing these drawbacks. It shows that artificially
encoded data can be stored and multiplied within plants.
There by in our project we are going to discuss about various research
in this field and the scope of the research. And to provide the 
information about the future storage tech that is the DNA storage
technologies.
Objective
The main objective of this project is to find out how DNA acts as a
storage medium and to know what are the advantages and
disadvantages of doing so. This research paper also deals with the
evolution of DNA storage throughout the time and what is the current
technique being used for it.
INTRODUCTION
Human civilization went through paradigm shifts with new ways of
storing and disseminating information. To survive in the complex and
ever-changing environment, our ancestors created utensils out of
wood, bone and stone, and used them as media for recording
information. This was the beginning of human history. With the
development of computer technology, the information age has
revolutionized the global scene. Digital information stored
in magnetic (floppy disks), optical (CDs) and electronic media (USB
sticks) and transmitted through the internet promoted the explosion of
next-generation science, technology and arts.
With the total amount of worldwide data skyrocketing, traditional
storage methods face daunting challenges. International Data
Corporation forecasts that the global data storage demand will grow to
175 ZB or 1.75 × 1014 GB by 2025 (in this review, ‘B’ refers to Byte
while ‘b’ refers to base pair). With the current storage media having a
maximal density of 103 GB/mm3, this will far exceed the storage
capacity of any currently available storage method. Meanwhile, the
costs of maintaining and transferring data, as well as limited lifespans
and significant data losses, also call for novel solutions for information
storage.
On the other hand, since the very beginning of life on Earth, nature has
solved this problem in its own way: it stores the information that
defines the organism in unique orders of four bases (A, T, C, G) located
in tiny molecules called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and this way of
storing information has continued for 3 billion years. DNA molecules as
information carriers have many advantages over traditional storage
media. Its high storage density, potentially low maintenance cost and
other excellent characteristics make it an ideal alternative for
information storage, and it is expected to provide wide practicality in
the future.
The Steps in Using Synthetic DNA for Storage:
 Convert your binary code into nucleotide code.
 Separate your codes into bits and insert an address code for each
fragment (including spacers for amplification).
 Synthesize your DNA as short fragments of oligonucleotides.
 Store in the freezer.
 When you need the archive, PCR amplify it and sequence it.
 Analyze the sequence data and re-assemble it.
 Finally, turn it back to binary code!
